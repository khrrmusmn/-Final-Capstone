Basic requirement for running Python code:
A user must install Python 3 for running this code.
How to install the released version:
First Step: a user should type at terminal git clone https://github.com/khrrmusmn/-Final-Capstone.git
Second Step: a user can the project directory: cd Financial-Calculator
Third Step: a user should run the script via Python.
Usage:
Once the user has run the script, the terminal will display the following options with explanation:
“investment – to calculate the amount of interest you will earn on your investment
bond – to calculate the amount of investment you will have to pay on a home loan
Enter either ‘investment’ or ‘bond’ from the above to proceed:”
If a user selects “investment”, the program asks: 
“how much amount you want to deposit?”
The next question turns up: “what is the interest rate they expect for?”
The user needs to answer the second question then: “for how many years you want to invest?”
“Enter your choice of interest rate either ‘simple’ or ‘compound’:”
It will show how much return the user will get in pound sterling on their investment.
If a user selects “bond”:
The program asks: “What is the present value of the house?”
“What is the interest rate you expect for?”
“How many months do you plan to take for repaying the bond?”
The program will calculate and display the return. 
Note: the answer depends upon inputs provided by the user.
